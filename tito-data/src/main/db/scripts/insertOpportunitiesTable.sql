BACKGROUND: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is the government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. On March 1, 2003, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officially assumed responsibility for the immigration service functions of the federal government. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2135) dismantled the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and separated the former agency into three components within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). USCIS was formed to enhance the security and improve the efficiency of national immigration services by exclusively focusing on the administration of benefit applications. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), components within DHS, handle immigration enforcement and border security functions. USCIS benefits from a legacy of more than 100 years of federal immigration and naturalization administration. REQUIREMENTS: Providing agile development teams of about 8-10 members per team, to use an agile (SCRUM/Lean-based) process Performing development and integration/configuration work based on coding standards, design, and architecture provided by the agency Working with teams from other contracts under govt. supervision to deliver systems and enhancements" from tito.sub_clients cli where cli.name= "Citizenship and Immigration Services";
